                    Even if you try and pamper your cat by offering them a sweet treat, they will still give you the same reaction. Surely you did not know that cats lack the taste receptor that perceives sweet tastes? Unfortunately, your cat will not be able to taste sweetness. More cake for us!

                    Cats have a whole repertoire of sounds to communicate, both among themselves and with other animals and people. In this way, they meow to humans as one more form of communication. It can mean several things, from hunger to "I want pampering" and they have learned that they can get things from us through meowing.
                    Although many believe that cats do not meow among themselves, the truth is that they do use this sound to communicate. Especially kittens to their mothers to indicate they are hungry. In this sense, it should be noted that each cat has their own meow, so that no two cats make the same sound, just as there are no two people with the same voice. Likewise, meowing is not the only way cats communicate with us. They can purr and grunt to request different types of attention. However, the favorite language of the felines to communicate with each other is body language; through gestures and sensations rather than through sounds.

                    To our surprise, cats dream just as we humans do. Cats, when they sleep and enter the deepest phase of sleep, have the ability to dream. That's because their mind produces the same pattern of brain waves that people have when we go into a sleep episode.

                    You will never see a cat drop a drop of sweat, making them look rather poised and elegant. They in fact sweat through their paws, not through their skin because they have very few sweat glands all over their body.
