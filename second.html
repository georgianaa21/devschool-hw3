                        It's no secret that cats love to sleep. In fact, the average kitty sleeps for a whopping 12 to 16 hours per day! Because cats are nocturnal creatures, they snooze most of the day away—and who can blame them? Everyone loves a nice, long nap in a cozy, comfy spot.

                        If you have a cat, you know they'll try to drink water from running faucets whenever the opportunity presents itself! Fortunately, there are tons of drinking fountains—designed especially for cats—so they always have cool, fresh, running water available.

                            One of cats' basic instincts is to sharpen their claws by scratching and clawing different surfaces. They also happen to get a ton of joy from it, too! 
                            In addition to sharpening their claws, scratching can help relax and rejuvenate cats. Think of it as the human equivalent to a nice, long stretch when your muscles are tired or achy. A quick scratch session can wake a tired kitty up immediately.
